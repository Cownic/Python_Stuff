Whenever python expects a single value, if multiple expressions are provided, seperated by commas, they are automatically packed into tuple

Python has a very powerful tuple assignment feature that allows a tuple of variable names on the left of an assignment statement to be assigned values from a tuple on the right of the assignment. 
Another way to think of this is that the tuple of values is unpacked into the variable names.

julia = "Julia", "Roberts", 1967, "Duplicity", 2009, "Actress", "Atlanta, Georgia"

name, surname, birth_year, movie, movie_year, profession, birth_place = julia
