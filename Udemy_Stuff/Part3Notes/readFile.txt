FILES (.txt & .csv)

- Ways to open the file for processing

file_variable = open(filename,'r')   | Open a file called filename and use it for reading. This will return a reference to a file object.

file_variable = open(filename,'w')   | Open a file called filename and use it for writing. This will also return a reference to a file object.

file_variable.close()                | File use is complete.

with open (filename , mode) as file_variable: --> automatically close when done

- Different waays to write to the file

file_variable.write(a_string)        | Add a string to the end of the file. file_variable must refer to a file that has been opened for writing.

- Different ways to read the file

file_variable.read(n)                | Read and return a string of n characters, or the entire file as a single string if n is not provided.

file_variable.readline()             | Read and return the next line of the file with all text up to and including the newline character. If n is provided as a parameter, then only n characters will be returned if the line is longer than n

file_variable.readlines()            | Returns a list of strings, each representing a single line of the file. If n is not provided then all lines of the file are returned. If n is provided then n characters are read but n is rounded up so that an entire line is returned.

- Recipe for Reading and processing file
fname = "yourfile.txt"
with open(fname, 'r') as fileref:         # step 1
    lines = fileref.readlines()           # step 2
    for lin in lines:                     # step 3
        #some code that references the variable lin
#some other code not relying on fileref   # step 4
